# ExoDrone
Exo is a racing drone frame with a unique design. It isn't your typical drone frame.  Most frames are made of relatively thick flat sheets of carbon fiber.  They have to be 3-5mm thick because racing drones produce intense thrust and thinner flat sheets would flex under the load. For the Exo we asked the question "what would a frame look like if it wasn't limited to flat sheets?"  Here are some of the things that make the Exo design unique:

1) 3D 'exo-skeleton' like design gives it strength along the axis of thrust, allowing for thinner/lighter/stronger materials and improved performance.
2) Enclosed electronics are shielded from weather and crash damage.
3) Multiple manufacturing possibilities - molded carbon fiber for maximum performance, vacuum forming for minimum price, or 3d printed for ease of manufacturing.

## What is an open source design?

Just like open source software, drone frames can be built using the open source model.  This means that the design is free to use (print/build/fly), can be forked/modified to suit your needs, and benifits from the collaboration of a community.  As the electronics evolve, so will the Exo frame!

# 3D Printing Instructions

* Download the STL files.
* Print the top/bottom and battery holder parts 
  + The flat side on the print bed, the batter holder is best printed with the opening face down.
  + Use a brim to ensure it's secured
  + Use 15% support with a triangular pattern
  + Use 100% infill
* Clean up parts with sand paper and/or dremel tool.  The bottom should fit snugly inside the top.
